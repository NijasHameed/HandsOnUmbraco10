# Umbraco v10 Demo

Demo site build in Umbraco v.10

# About this solution:

This is a demo site for Umbraco v10 build in the new .NET Core v6 version. It is built as an experiment/investigation and should not be used as a template for your next Umbraco site. Use it as a reference if you will and steal whatever you like and ignore the things you dont.

This is not the way of building Umbraco sites, it's a way. There are less complex ways of building Umbraco sites, so if you are new to Umbraco make sure you read the official docs and don't use this this project as your only source of inspiration.
